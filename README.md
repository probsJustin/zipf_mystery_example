There is a video floating around that seems to suggest that all forms of writing follow a certain path....

That is just not true: 

if you go to [this page here to view the outputs and ratio's of The Bee Movie](https://github.com/wheelsmanx/zipf_myster_example/blob/master/output.txt)

This is in the syntax of "[\<word\>] : <word count> is <ratio of this word in (this word count / total word count)>" 
  
I am sure this could be true for most works as a statistical probability? but I did this test to show that it is not as "certain" on such a small scale like the bee movie as this video leads everyone to believe.. 

Please let me know if I am perhaps interpreting the law incorrectly... 

From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law
  ``` For example, in the Brown Corpus of American English text, the word the is the most frequently occurring word, and by itself accounts for nearly 7% of all word occurrences (69,971 out of slightly over 1 million). True to Zipf's Law, the second-place word of accounts for slightly over 3.5% of words (36,411 occurrences), followed by and (28,852). Only 135 vocabulary items are needed to account for half the Brown Corpus.[1]```
